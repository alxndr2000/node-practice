# node-practice
Requirements: node.js and docker

Built on docker for windows, needs porting

This is a simple application that allows a user to rate a number (1-1000) on a yes/no scale arbitraraly, just to find out what happens

This is mostly just a project to improve my development skills

## Overview of work to do
<br>

### General
1. Ensure compatability with linux
### DB
1. Nothing to do, works as intended


### NodeBackend (Input and Output to DB+logging)
1. Setup route for data input
2. Setup route for simple data input page (basic form)
3. Logging - blocked by grafana

### ReactFrontend (User Interface)
0. Consider react alternitives
1. Setup a basic react app
2. Get it talking to node
3. Figure out how the fuck React works

### Grafana/Prometheus (Monitoring)
1. Needs setup after the backend completed

### (Optional) PHPmyadmin for ease of db tinkering
1. Might get ignored as is not required, might be 'fun'
